final project for CSI2300, it will be a collection of mini games
mini game 1 will be simon says. there will be a sequence of blinking colors, which need to be memorized. the user will then be asked to input these colors in order. failure to do so will cause you to lose the game. the game is played until the user loses. 

mini game 2 will be a color matching game. the user must drag sliders to change their color and match the other color. it will then display a percentage of how close the user was to the color that was displayed. a high score will be kept per session

mini game 3 will be hangman. the computer will generate spaces for the user to fill, and the user will get a certain amount of guesses for what the phrase or word is. after 6 attempts the user then loses the game if they have not guessed the word. submit one letter to guess a letter, and anything more than 1 letter will be considered a word submission
