final project for CSI2300, it will be a collection of mini games
mini game 1 will be simon says. there will be a sequence of blinking colors, which need to be memorized. the user will then be asked to input these colors in order. failure to do so will cause you to lose the game. the game is played until the user loses. there are multiple difficulties, which use more colors, and blink faster.

mini game 2 will be a color matching game. the user must drag a slider to change their color and match the other color. it will then display a percentage of how close the user was to the color that was displayed.

mini game 3 will be hangman. the computer will generate spaces for the user to fill, and the user will get a certain amount of guesses for what the phrase or word is. after a certain amount of guesses the user is given a hint about the word or phrase. 

The amount of work put into this so far is about 14 hours. however there are still improvements being made.
